        dt.col-3 What does Cube Cobra provide that other tools do not?
        dd.col-9
            p The biggest advantage Cube Cobra has right now is a more modern and maintainable technology stack compared to other tools. This means Cube Cobra is updated frequently and is committed to
                |  adding features that the community asks for. There are some features that are are big improvements over other tools,
                |  such as an easier way to manage card versions, a sortable cube view, and since the website is powered by scryfall, newly spoiled cards can be used at most 24 hrs
                |  after being spoiled, with no downtime!

        dd.col-9

                |  bootstrap for CSS, and relies heavily on Scryfall API.
